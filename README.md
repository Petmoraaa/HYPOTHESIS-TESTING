Salamander Species Identification: Hypothesis Testing
Overview
This project applies hypothesis testing to assist a laboratory in identifying new species of salamanders. The goal is to determine whether a sample of salamanders is from a population with a mean length smaller than a known species, based on historical data. 

**The data**
The population mean length of a known species of salamander.
The standard deviation of the known species length.
The sample mean length of a new salamander sample.
The sample size.


**Findings**
Z-Score: The z-score calculated for this sample is -0.77, indicating a small difference between the sample and population means.
Rejecting the Null Hypothesis: With a critical z-value of -0.84 at an 80% confidence level, the null hypothesis is not rejected, meaning there is insufficient evidence to conclude the sample is from a smaller population.


Sources
The dataset was generated using historical data provided by the laboratory.
All analysis was performed using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and libraries such as SciPy and NumPy
